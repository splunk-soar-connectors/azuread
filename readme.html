    <h2>Authentication</h2>
      <p>This app requires creating a Microsoft Azure Application. To do so, navigate to <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">https://portal.azure.com</a> in a browser and log in with a Microsoft account, then select <b>Azure Active Directory</b>.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Go to <b>App Registrations</b> and click on <b>+ New registration</b>.</li>
        <li>Give the app an appropriate name. The Redirect URI will be populated in a later step.</li>
        <li>Select a supported account type (configure the application to be multitenant).</li>
        <li>Click on the <b>Register</b>.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Under <b>Certificates & secrets</b>, add <b>New client secret</b>. Note this key somewhere secure, as it cannot be retrieved after closing the window.</li>
          <li>Under <b>Redirect URIs</b> we will be updating the entry of https://phantom.local to reflect the actual redirect URI.  We will get this from the Phantom asset we create below in the section titled "Configure the Azure AD Graph Phantom app Asset"
          <li>Under <b>API Permissions</b>, click on <b>Add a permission</b>.</li>
          <li>Go to <b>Microsoft Graph Permissions</b>, the following <b>Delegated Permissions</b> need to be added:
            <ul>
                <li>User.Read</li>
                <li>User.Read.All</li>
                <li>Directory.ReadWrite.All</li>
                <li>Directory.AccessAsUser.All</li>
                <li>Directory.ReadWrite.All</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li> Click on the <b>Add permissions</b>.</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>

      After making these changes, click on <b>Grant admin consent</b>.

    <h2>Configure the Azure AD Graph Phantom app Asset</h2>
      When creating an asset for the <b>Azure AD Graph</b> app, place the <b>Application ID</b> of the app created during the previous step in the <b>Client ID</b> field and place the password generated during the app creation process in the <b>Client Secret</b> field. Then, after filling out the <b>Tenant</b> field, click <b>SAVE</b>.
      <br><br>
      After saving, a new field will appear in the <b>Asset Settings</b> tab. Take the URL found in the <b>POST incoming for Azure AD Graph to this location</b> field and place it in the <b>Redirect URIs</b> field mentioned in a previous step. To this URL, add <b>/result</b>. After doing so the URL should look something like:
      <br><br>
      <p>
        https://&lt;phantom_host&gt;/rest/handler/azureadgraph_c6d3b801-5c26-4abd-9e89-6d8007e2778f/&lt;asset_name&gt;/result
      </p>
      <br>
      Once again, click on Save.
    <h2>User Permissions</h2>
    To complete the authorization process, this app needs permission to view assets, which is not granted by default. First, under <b>asset settings</b>, check which user is listed under <b>Select a user on behalf of which automated actions can be executed</b>. By default, the user will be <b>automation</b>, but this user can be changed by clicking <b>EDIT</b> at the bottom of the window. To give this user permission to view assets, follow these steps:
    <ul>
        <li>In the main drop-down menu, select <b>Administration</b>, then select the <b>User Management</b>, and under that tab, select <b>Roles</b>. Finally, click <b>+ ROLE</b>.</li>
        <li>In the <b>Add Role</b> wizard, give the role a name (e.g <b>Asset Viewer</b>), and provide a description. Subsequently, under <b>Available Users</b>, add the user assigned to the asset viewed earlier. Then click the <b>Permissions</b> tab.</li>
        <li>On the permission tab, under <b>Available Privileges</b>, give the role the <b>View Assets</b> privilege. Then click <b>SAVE</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method to Run Test Connectivity</h2>
    After setting up the asset and user, click the <b>TEST CONNECTIVITY</b> button. A window should pop up and display a URL. Navigate to this URL in a separate browser tab. This new tab will redirect to a Microsoft login page. Log in to a Microsoft account with administrator privileges to the Azure AD environment. After logging in, review the requested permissions listed, then click <b>Accept</b>. Finally, close that tab. The test connectivity window should show a success.
      <br><br>
      The app should now be ready to use.

    <h2>State File Permissions</h2>
      Please check the permissions for the state file as mentioned below.
      <h4>State Filepath</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>For Non-NRI Instance: /opt/phantom/local_data/app_states/c6d3b801-5c26-4abd-9e89-6d8007e2778f/{asset_id}_state.json</li>

      </ul>
